              Ever since I was a kid, I've loved being creative and curious as
              an individual. With a pen and a paper, I found myself escaping the
              world - as If time didn't exist!
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              This curiosity led me to a ton of experiences as the years went
              by: from studying and living in London, to trying out different
              jobs and embarking engineering studies at KTH. However, I found
              myself not really haven found my passion. This is where
              programming took in place! I had friends studying computer science
              that nudged me to try it out - and man, was I hooked!
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              That passion led me to where I am now â€“ a full-stack developer
              student at Chas Academy. Right now, I'm on the lookout for
              internships in development from December 2024 to late may 2025.
              I'm pumped to share what I know and learn from other pros in the
              field.
